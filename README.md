# PRISM Learning Projects

This repository contains small projects created using the **PRISM Model Checker**. I'm using these toy examples to learn and experiment with modeling and verifying probabilistic systems.

## Projects Included

1. **Coin Flip**:
   - A simple DTMC model to calculate the probability of flipping heads and expected steps to achieve specific outcomes.
   - Files: `coin_flip.prism`, `coin_flip.props`

2. **Dice Game**:
   - A probabilistic dice game where the goal is to reach a sum of 15, with losing conditions for consecutive rolls of 1.
   - Files: `dice_game.prism`, `dice_game.props`

3. **Random Walk**:
   - A random walk on a finite line with reflective boundaries.
   - Files: `random_walk.prism`, `random_walk.props`

4. **Traffic Light Controller**:
   - A cyclic traffic light system with Green, Yellow, and Red states modeled as a DTMC.
   - Files: `traffic_light.prism`, `traffic_light.props`

5. **Probabilistic Two-State Machine**:
   - A simple DTMC alternating between two states with probabilistic transitions.
   - Files: `probabilistic_two_state.prism`, `probabilistic_two_state.props`

6. **Two-State Machine**:
   - A basic DTMC that alternates deterministically between two states.
   - Files: `two_state.prism`, `two_state.props`

7. **Epidemic Model**:
   - A WIP, at the moment recovered individuals CAN be reinfected. but its not heterogeneous yet. I'm not even sure if PRISM supports arrays tbh.

## Output Files

Each project has an accompanying output file (`*.txt`) containing the results of property verification using PRISM. These include probabilities, expected steps, and steady-state calculations.

## Usage

1. **Install PRISM**: Download and install PRISM from [prismmodelchecker.org](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/).
2. **Run a Project**:
   - Example for the `coin_flip` project:
     ```bash
     prism coin_flip.prism coin_flip.props > coin_flip_output.txt
     ```
3. **Analyze the Output**:
   - Open the respective output file (e.g., `coin_flip_output.txt`) to review the results of the model checking.

## Example Output: Coin Flip

Hereâ€™s an example output from running the **Coin Flip** project:

```
### Explanation:
Property Checked: ```P=? [ F "got_heads" ]```
This computes the probability of eventually flipping a heads starting from the initial state.
### Key Metrics:
```States```: The model has 7 states, with 1 initial state.

```Transitions```: There are 10 possible transitions between states.

```Result```: 0.875 (87.5% probability).
This means there is an 87.5% chance of flipping heads eventually.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the structure of PRISM models.
- Learn to write properties using PCTL.
- Analyze probabilities, rewards, and steady-state behavior.
- Experiment with small, modular projects to build intuition for probabilistic model checking.
